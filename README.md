# ucrypt

This software library is designed to aid in encrypting, decrypting, and breaking
text using Vigenere/Caesar cipher. Future plans include an interactive terminal
mode and steganography support. This is not intended for any real security, but
for recreational use (games/puzzles).

## Running
To build the program, run
```
make all
```

To run, execute `bin/ucrypt`. Specific help can be found in the man page in docs
